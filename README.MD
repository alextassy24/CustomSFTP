## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

-   **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later (also compatible with Linux and macOS).
-   **.NET SDK:** [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) installed.

-   **Git:** [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed (optional, for cloning the repository).

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository (Optional):**

    If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CustomSftpTool.git
    cd CustomSftpTool
    ```

    Alternatively, you can download the source code as a ZIP file from the repository and extract it to your desired location.

2. **Building the Application**

    To build the application from source, follow these steps:

    - Navigate to the Project Directory:

        Open a terminal or PowerShell window and navigate to the root directory of the project where the `.csproj` file is located.

        ```powershell
        cd C:\path\to\CustomSftpTool
        ```

    - Restore Dependencies:

        Restore the necessary NuGet packages.

        ```powershell
        dotnet restore
        ```

    - Build the Project:

        Build the project in Release configuration.

        ```powershell
        dotnet build -c Release
        ```

    **Output:**

    After a successful build, the binaries will be located in the `bin\Release\net8.0\` directory.

3. **Publishing as a Standalone Executable**

    To run CustomSftpTool as a standalone executable named `customSFTP`, you need to publish it as a self-contained application.

    - Set the Assembly Name (Optional):

        To ensure the executable is named `customSFTP`, update the `<AssemblyName>` in your `.csproj` file.

        ```xml
        <PropertyGroup>
          <AssemblyName>customSFTP</AssemblyName>
          <!-- Other properties -->
        </PropertyGroup>
        ```

    - Publish the Application:

        Run the `dotnet publish` command with the appropriate Runtime Identifier (RID).

        ```powershell
        dotnet publish CustomSftpTool.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -o ./publish
        ```

        **Parameters:**

        - `-c Release`: Build configuration.
        - `-r win-x64`: Target runtime. Change this based on your OS:
            - Windows x64: `win-x64`
            - Linux x64: `linux-x64`
            - macOS x64: `osx-x64`
            - macOS ARM64: `osx-arm64`
        - `--self-contained true`: Publish as a self-contained application.
        - `-p:PublishSingleFile=true`: Bundle the application into a single executable.
        - `-o ./publish`: Output directory.

    **Output:**

    After publishing, the publish directory will contain `customSFTP.exe` (on Windows) or `customSFTP` (on Linux/macOS).

4. **Adding customSFTP to the System PATH**

    Adding `customSFTP` to your system's PATH allows you to run it from any directory without specifying its full path.

    **Method 1: Adding the publish Directory to PATH**

    - Determine the Full Path:

        For example:

        ```plaintext
        C:\path\to\CustomSftpTool\publish
        ```

    - Add to PATH via PowerShell:

        ```powershell
        [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";C:\path\to\CustomSftpTool\publish", "User")
        ```

    - Update Current Session:

        To make the change effective immediately in the current PowerShell session:

        ```powershell
        $env:Path += ";C:\path\to\CustomSftpTool\publish"
        ```

    - Verify PATH Update:

        ```powershell
        echo $env:Path
        ```

        Ensure that `C:\path\to\CustomSftpTool\publish` is listed.

    - Restart PowerShell:

        Close and reopen PowerShell to apply the changes.

    - Run `customSFTP`:

        Now, you can run:

        ```powershell
        customSFTP --help
        ```

    **Method 2: Copying customSFTP.exe to an Existing PATH Directory**

    - Locate a PATH Directory:

        Common directories include:

        - `C:\Windows\System32`
        - `C:\Windows`
        - `C:\Program Files`

    - Copy the Executable:

        Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

        ```powershell
        Copy-Item -Path "C:\path\to\CustomSftpTool\publish\customSFTP.exe" -Destination "C:\Windows\System32\customSFTP.exe"
        ```

    - Run `customSFTP`:

        ```powershell
        customSFTP --help
        ```

        Note: Administrative privileges are required to copy files to system directories.

## Deployment

Deploying your application using CustomSftpTool is seamless once you've set up your profiles.

### Steps to Deploy

1. **Ensure Your Profile Is Correct:**

    Verify that the profile you intend to use has all the necessary details and no errors.

    ```powershell
    customSFTP --show-profile "Profile Name"
    ```

2. **Run the Deploy Command:**

    ```powershell
    customSFTP --deploy "Profile Name"
    ```

    - Example:

    ```powershell
    customSFTP --deploy "Production Server"
    ```

# Deployment Process:

-   The tool will perform the following actions:
    -   Clean the Application: Runs dotnet clean on the specified .csproj file.
    -   Publish the Application: Runs dotnet publish to build and prepare the application for deployment.
    -   Connect to SSH: Establishes an SSH connection to the specified host.
    -   Manage Service: Checks the status of the specified service. Stops the service if it's running.
    -   Transfer Files: Uses SFTP to upload the published files to the remote directory, excluding specified files/directories.
    -   Restart Service: Starts the service again and verifies its status.

# Monitor Logs:

-   Deployment logs are saved in the logs directory. You can monitor these logs for detailed information or troubleshooting.

    ```powershell
    notepad C:\path\to\CustomSftpTool\publish\logs\deployment.log
    ```

# Troubleshooting

-   Encountering issues? Here are some common problems and their solutions.

    1. customSFTP Not Recognized

    -   Symptom:

    ```powershell
    customSFTP: The term 'customSFTP' is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or executable program.
